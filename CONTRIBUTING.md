# Contributing to Better Auth PCI DSS Plugin ü§ù

We welcome contributions to the Better Auth PCI DSS Plugin! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## üìã **Code of Conduct**

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- Understanding of PCI DSS security requirements
- Familiarity with Better Auth framework

### **Development Setup**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/better-auth-pci-dss-plugin.git
cd better-auth-pci-dss-plugin

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## üîß **Development Guidelines**

### **Security First**
- **Never expose sensitive data** in user-facing APIs
- **Use bcrypt** for all password hashing (minimum cost factor 12)
- **Follow least privilege** principle in database access
- **Validate all inputs** and sanitize outputs
- **Log security events** appropriately (without sensitive data)

### **Code Standards**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Secure, typed, and clear
interface PCIDSSOptions {
  passwordHistoryCount: number;
  passwordChangeIntervalDays: number;
}

async function validatePasswordHistory(
  password: string,
  userId: string,
  adapter: DatabaseAdapter
): Promise<void> {
  const history = await adapter.findMany({
    model: "pciPasswordHistory",
    where: [{ field: "userId", value: userId }],
    limit: 12,
    orderBy: [{ field: "createdAt", direction: "desc" }],
  });
  
  for (const entry of history) {
    if (await bcrypt.compare(password, entry.passwordHash)) {
      throw new Error("Password cannot be one of the last 12 used passwords");
    }
  }
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Insecure and unclear
function checkPassword(pwd: any, user: any) {
  if (user.oldPasswords.includes(pwd)) {
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

### **Database Best Practices**
- Use **dedicated tables** for sensitive data
- Implement **proper foreign key constraints**
- Include **cascade deletion** for cleanup
- Add **appropriate indexes** for performance
- Never store **plaintext passwords**

## üß™ **Testing Requirements**

### **Test Coverage**
All contributions must include comprehensive tests:

```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('Password History Validation', () => {
  it('should reject password that matches history', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const mockAdapter = createMockAdapter();
    const testPassword = 'TestPassword123!';
    
    // Act & Assert
    await expect(
      validatePasswordHistory(testPassword, 'user-123', mockAdapter)
    ).rejects.toThrow('Password cannot be one of the last');
  });
  
  it('should allow password that does not match history', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### **Security Testing**
- **Input validation** tests for all user inputs
- **SQL injection** prevention verification
- **Access control** boundary testing
- **Error handling** security tests

### **Running Tests**
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run security-specific tests
npm run test:security
```
